# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Setup and run project
If you just cloned the project, in the terminal, go to the project's directory and install packages:
```
npm install
```
Launch frontend server
```
npm run dev
```
The server will now run in `http://localhost:3000/`. The port can be changed in *vite.config.js*
